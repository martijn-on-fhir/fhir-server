## Making Changes

### Before You Start

- Check the [issues](../../issues) to see if someone else is already working on the same thing
- Create an issue to discuss major changes before implementing them
- Make sure your changes align with the project's goals and scope

### Development Process

1. **Keep your fork up to date**:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git checkout main
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

2. **Create a new branch** for each feature or bug fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/descriptive-name
   ```

3. **Make your changes** following the project's coding standards

4. **Test your changes** thoroughly

5. **Commit your changes** with clear, descriptive messages:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature: brief description of what you did"
   ```

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process

1. **Push your branch** to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Create a pull request** from your fork to the main repository

3. **Fill out the PR template** completely:
    - Describe what your changes do
    - Reference any related issues
    - Include screenshots for UI changes
    - List any breaking changes

4. **Wait for review** and be responsive to feedback

### Pull Request Guidelines

- **One feature per PR**: Keep pull requests focused and atomic
- **Clear description**: Explain what you changed and why
- **Reference issues**: Use "Fixes #123" or "Closes #123" to link issues
- **Update documentation**: Include relevant documentation updates
- **Add tests**: Ensure your changes are covered by tests
- **Keep it small**: Large PRs are harder to review

## Style Guidelines

    - JavaScript: Use ESLint and Prettier configurations
